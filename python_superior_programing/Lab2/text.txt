Over the last seven months, my Administration has worked tirelessly with Governors to respond to COVID-19. Through our work together, we have built a robust COVID-19 testing ecosystem, and I am pleased to be providing additional rapid point-of-care tests to continue to enhance our Nation's testing system.

In March, I challenged American biotechnology companies to develop a rapid, inexpensive, and accurate test. Abbott Laboratories has now delivered. My Administration recently announced the purchase of 150 million Abbott Laboratories BinaxNOWTM rapid point-of-care tests. I am especially proud these tests are being Made in America, by Americans, and for Americans. Moreover, the swabs used for this test are available because of my Administration's use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to invest in domestic manufacturing. This is a major development that will help save more lives by further protecting Americaâ€™s most vulnerable and allowing our country to get Americans back to work and children back to school.

Last week, we began deploying BinaxNOWTM rapid point-of-care tests to our Nation's higher-risk, vulnerable populations. This included distributing tests to those impacted by natural disasters as well as to assisted living centers, nursing homes, HBCUs, and Native American communities. We will provide you a list of previous distribution locations in your state this week. My Administration will provide continual supplies of BinaxNOWTM tests for vulnerable populations through the end of the year.
